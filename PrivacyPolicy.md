Privacy Policy â€“ BetterLyrics

Effective Date: June 3, 2025

Thank you for using BetterLyrics.

BetterLyrics is a local lyrics viewer application built with WinUI 3. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.

1. No Personal Data Collection
BetterLyrics does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All lyrics, preferences, and settings are stored locally on your device. We do not access or send your information to any server.

2. Internet Usage
BetterLyrics does not require an internet connection for its core functionality. The app does not make any network requests or communicate with external services unless you manually choose to view external resources (such as a linked demo video).

3. Third-Party Libraries
BetterLyrics uses third-party open-source libraries (e.g., Win2D, CommunityToolkit, DevWinUI). These libraries are used locally and do not perform any background tracking or data transmission.

4. Changes to This Policy
If our privacy practices change in the future (for example, if online lyrics fetching is added), we will update this policy accordingly and notify users through app updates or store listing.

5. Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at: founchoo@outlook.com
